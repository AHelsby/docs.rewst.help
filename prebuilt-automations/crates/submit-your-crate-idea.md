# Submit your Crate Idea

### Submit Your Idea

Crates are really important to Rewst and allow us to put some awesome workflows in the hands of all of our clients without any additional configuration needed. The aim is to have our ROC team adding to the crate marketplace all the time, but it's equally important for us to give you folks what you want!

If you have any cool workflow ideas, you can submit your crate ideas by going to the [Crate Roadmap in Canny](https://rewst.canny.io/crates) and create a post.
