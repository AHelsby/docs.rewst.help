## New Support Process at Rewst

Hello, Rewst community! We're making some changes to ensure we can offer you the best possible support, in the quickest time possible. As we scale, we want to always ensure the best possible support. To do that, we're introducing a new process for more urgent support queries.

### When to Log a Ticket

If you have a pressing issue that needs immediate attention, please log a ticket via Discord. This process is outlined in our [documentation](../../). This is different from having a casual discussion on your channel.

### How to Log a Ticket

To log a ticket, [use the command to create a ticket from a message](create-a-ticket-via-discord.md). This will alert our support team and they will respond as quickly as possible.&#x20;

### Our Commitment

We're setting internal objectives to reply to ticket queries faster than standard messages. While we love chatting with you, this new process will help us prioritize urgent issues and ensure they're resolved quickly.

### Questions?

If you have any questions about this new process, feel free to tag a member of the ROC or via our [Contact Us page](../contact-resources.md). We're here to help!

### Office Hours and ROC AMA

For those going through our [Rewst Foundations Training](../../cluck-university/rewst-foundations-10x/), you can join our weekly [Office Hours](../../cluck-university/office-hours.md) to get help with questions from training or implementing what you're learning.

If you have completed your [Rewst Foundations Certification](../../cluck-university/rewst-foundations-10x/foundations-certification.md), you can join our weekly [ROC AMA](../../cluck-university/roc-ama.md) to work through questions directly with a ROC member!&#x20;

Thanks for being a part of our community.
