The Goal Here at **Rewst**, our goal is to revolutionise your experience. Not just through our standard support but by adapting and introducing platforms that redefine community engagement.

### Introducing: ROC-n-Roll

Ever catch yourself musing,

> _"Bloody hell, I've aced the Cluck-U courses, but building this is another beast altogether!"_?

Perhaps you've whispered to your coffee mug,

> _"I just wish there was someone who could guide me through this maze."_

Well, it's not just the caffeine talking back; it's **Rewst** with our Unified **ROC-n-Roll** training programme.

At the very core of ROC-n-Roll is our unwavering commitment to multi-departmental collaboration. We're not just pulling a ROC initiative here. It's an all-hands-on-deck approach, with expertise and insights pouring in from every nook and cranny of our organisation, ensuring you're not just heard, but also guided, inspired, and supported every step of the way.

In a standard playbook, the story goes something like this: **Sales > Post Sales > CS / Support**. But once you're on board, you're left feeling like you're playing a game of broken telephone‚Äîdisconnected from the very voices that introduced you to the magic of the product.

With ROC-n-Roll, and honestly, with Rewst as a whole, we toss that playbook out the window. We believe in defying the "norms" and thinking beyond the confined box.

Why? Because our journey with you doesn't end with a signed contract or a successful sale. It's an ongoing partnership, a continued conversation. It's about reigniting those initial sparks of ideas and translating them into tangible results.

Here's how our various departments come into play:

### "But Don't You Already Offer Training?"

Yes, you're spot on! We're proud of our Cluck-U programme, and the dedicated team behind it hasn't missed a beat. They're consistently rolling out top-tier course materials, refining our certification programmes, and ensuring there's a well-lit path tailored to suit every learner's style and objectives.

However, **ROC-n-Roll** fills a unique niche. It's like that handy multi-tool you never knew you needed until you're faced with a peculiar task. While Cluck-U is your go-to for structured syllabi and foundational understanding, ROC-n-Roll swoops in when you've got those off-the-beaten-path queries, those not-so-square-peg questions that don't snugly fit within Cluck-U's Open Hours or its conventional curriculum.

In other words, think of Cluck-U as your trusted textbook and ROC-n-Roll as that savvy mentor you can nudge for insights beyond the pages!

### ROC-n-Roll _Dedicated_ Open Hours

Join us daily for dedicated sessions where our experienced teams are available to chat. No prerequisites, just come as you are.

### ROC-n-Roll _General_ Open Hours

**And that's not all!**

Whilst we have dedicated hours for specific topics, our virtual rooms are staffed throughout the day too! Having a group discussion and need a more seamless platform? Try out our **NEW, PUBLIC AREA**.

### Introducing Gather Town

**Gather Town** is our next-generation platform that amalgamates virtual interaction and professional networking. Here‚Äôs a quick guide on what it brings to the table:

#### What is Gather?

Think of it as a marriage between fun virtual worlds and serious business meet-ups. It‚Äôs more than just a video chat; it's an interactive space where avatars can move around, engage in conversations, and even form breakout groups. It also allows multiple people to share their screens at the same time.

#### How to Use Gather

1. **Avatar Movement**: Control your avatar using the arrow keys.
2. **Breakout Rooms**: Want focused group discussions? Head to one of the designated breakout rooms. These are perfect for smaller teams or topic-specific chats.
3. **Group Area**: For broader discussions or announcements, use the central group area. It‚Äôs designed for larger audiences and community-wide engagements.

#### Availability and Hours

While we have dedicated hours for specific topics, our **Gather** space is open beyond that based on team availability. We‚Äôre committed to:

* **Guaranteed Hours**: The times listed previously are set in stone. You'll always find someone from our team available.
* **Open Hours**: In addition to dedicated times, we're targeting 10 extra open hours every week. These hours will grow based on demand and our team‚Äôs capacity.

#### Engage on Your Terms

Remember, whether you‚Äôre jumping in for a scheduled session or during open hours, if the room seems empty, hit the notification button. If someone's available, they‚Äôll try and join you.

In essence, **Gather** empowers you to engage with the Rewst community and team on your terms, ensuring you always have a platform to voice your thoughts, concerns, and ideas.
