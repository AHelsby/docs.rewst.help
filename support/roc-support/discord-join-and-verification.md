# Discord Join & Verification

## Discord Verification Process

To streamline your onboarding experience, we've implemented a new verification process for joining and interacting with our Discord servers. Whether you're new to our community or already a member, follow the steps below to get set up quickly and easily.

{% hint style="warning" %}
During the Discord verification process, we temporarily ask for access to "Join servers on your behalf" - this is done using the User API Token generated during the process. \
\
We do not store this token.
{% endhint %}

### If You Are Already in the Community Server but need to access your Support Server

If you're already part of our community server, you can use the `/verify` command within Discord to start the verification process or use the above instructions to go directly to the form itself:

1. **Use the `/verify` Command**\
   In the Discord server, type `/verify` in any channel.
2. **Follow the Provided Link**\
   The bot will respond with a link to the verification form. Click on this link to open the form.
3. **Confirm Your Organization**\
   Ensure that the form displays your organization's name correctly.
4. **Select "Me"**\
   Choose the "Me" option if you’re verifying yourself.
5. **Authorise Discord Access**\
   Click on the link that says "Click here to authorise access to Discord" and follow the prompts to sign in or authorise.
6. **Verification Complete**\
   After authorising, you'll be redirected to a confirmation page, and your channel will be created automatically.

By following these steps, you'll be successfully verified and added to the appropriate Discord servers, ensuring you have access to the resources you need.
