When you encounter an issue that needs our attention, creating a ticket is a straightforward process. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Right-click the message** that pertains to the issue you're experiencing.
2. A menu will appear. Look for the option to **"Create a Ticket"** under Apps and click on it.
3. You'll be prompted to fill in some details. Please provide the following:
   * **Name**: Your full name.
   * **Email**: The best email to reach you at.
   * **Acceptance Criteria**: Please describe what would need to happen for you to consider this issue resolved. This helps us understand your expectations and work towards meeting them.
   * **Ticket Details:** Enter the actual details around the support query
4. Note that this should create a thread within the channel you make the ticket from, to allow for easier communication on that specific issue.

Once you've filled in these details, submit the ticket. Our ROC team will review it and get back to you based on the[ priority level of your issue.](support-priorities.md)
