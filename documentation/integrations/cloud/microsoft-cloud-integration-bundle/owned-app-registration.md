# Owned App Registration

***

## Overview

For users who need customized control over their Microsoft integrations, using an Owned App Registration created within your Microsoft tenant allows for tailored configuration and security settings. This option is ideal for organizations with specific compliance or operational requirements requiring more control than what the Rewst Cloud Connector already provides.

We've surfaced some high-level guidance below. For additional details or questions related to registering and managing your own applications, please refer to [Microsoft's QuickStart Guide: Registering an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app).

## **Configuration Instructions**

1. **Access the Azure Portal:** Log into your [Microsoft Entra Admin Center](https://entra.microsoft.com). Under `Identity` click `Applications` -> `App Registrations`
2. **Create or Select an App Registration:** If you havenâ€™t already, click `New registration` to create a new application or select an existing one from the `Owned applications` list.
3. **Configure Redirect URL**: A _redirect URI_ is the location where the Microsoft identity platform redirects a user's client and sends security tokens after authentication. To ensure Rewst can communicate with your App Registration after authentication, set this to: `https://engine.rewst.io/integrations/bundles/microsoft_cloud/callback`
4. **Gather Information:** note the `Client ID`, and generate a `Client Secret` under `Certificates & secrets` for inputting into Rewst fields.
5. **Clarify Single vs. Multi-tenant:** For the the `Auth Subject` field, choose between:
   * `common` if your app registration is set to be accessible from multiple tenants.
   * `Tenant ID` if your app registration is restricted to your own tenant.

{% hint style="info" %}
When using an owned App Registration with the `tenant_id` Auth Subject, **make sure you include the ID in the Tenant ID field**. This will be what Rewst uses to generate the authentication URL.
