# Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle Documentation

## Overview

The Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle is a unified package that brings together Rewst's integrations with Microsoft services, including Microsoft Graph, Exchange Online, CSP, and Azure. This approach is designed to replace the legacy Rewst Prod App Registration with either the new Rewst MS Cloud Connector or an owned App Registration within your Microsoft tenant.

## Key Benefits

* **Granular Permission Control**: Tailor permissions to your organization's specific needs, ensuring that you have just what you need and nothing more.
* **Simplified Management**: Say goodbye to juggling multiple integration pages. Manage all your Microsoft integrations from one convenient place.
* **Enhanced Security**: With advanced security measures in place, rest assured that your data is in safe hands.
* **Future-Proof**: Transition to the latest setup and stay ahead with continuous enhancements and updates.

## Core Components

* **Microsoft Graph**: Unify management of Microsoft Cloud services and data.
* **Exchange Online**: Advanced email and calendar management at your fingertips.
* **Azure Integration**: Leverage the power of Microsoft Azure for comprehensive cloud computing solutions.
* **Microsoft CSP**: Effortlessly manage Cloud Solution Provider subscriptions and services.

## Choosing Your App Registration

Rewst provides two pathways for app registration to ensure flexibility and control:

* **Rewst MS Cloud Connector**: Ideal for those seeking a streamlined integration experience with controlled permissions, this option simplifies the integration process.
* **Owned App Registration**: For organizations with an existing setup, this option allows you to integrate Rewst's services using your own app registration, offering maximum customization.

Select the option that best aligns with your operational requirements and security standards.
