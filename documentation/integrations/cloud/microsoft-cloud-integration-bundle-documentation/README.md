# Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle Documentation

## Overview

The Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle is a unified package that brings together Rewst's integrations with Microsoft services, including Microsoft Graph, Exchange Online, CSP, and Azure. This approach is designed to replace the legacy Rewst Prod App Registration with either the new Rewst MS Cloud Connector or an owned App Registration within your Microsoft tenant.

## Key Benefits

* **Granular Permission Control**: Tailor permissions to your organization's specific needs, ensuring that you have just what you need and nothing more.
* **Simplified Management**: Say goodbye to juggling multiple integration pages. Manage all your Microsoft integrations from one convenient place.
* **Enhanced Security**: With advanced security measures in place, rest assured that your data is in safe hands.
* **Future-Proof**: Transition to the latest setup and stay ahead with continuous enhancements and updates.

## Getting Started with the Bundle

1. **Login**: Access your Rewst account by navigating to the Rewst platform and logging in with your credentials.
2. **Navigate to Integration Setup**: Once logged in, proceed to the dashboard, and under Configuration -> Integrations, locate the Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle.

### **App Registration Options**
