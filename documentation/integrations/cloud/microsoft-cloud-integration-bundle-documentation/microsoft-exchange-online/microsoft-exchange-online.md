{% hint style="warning" %}
**New: Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle!** ðŸŒŸ We've combined our Microsoft integrations into a single, streamlined package for easier management and enhanced security.

## **Introduction**

The Microsoft Exchange Online integration in the Rewst Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle provides advanced email and calendar management capabilities. This integration simplifies the administration of Exchange services, enhancing productivity and security within your organization.

## **Key Features**

* **Advanced Email Management**: Manage user mailboxes, settings, and security policies efficiently.
* **Enhanced Calendar Capabilities**: Facilitate better scheduling and calendar sharing across your organization.
* **Seamless Integration**: Works closely with other Microsoft services for a cohesive management experience, particularly with Microsoft Graph for enhanced functionality.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Access the Integration Bundle**

* Log into the Rewst dashboard.

* Click 'Next' to proceed.

### **Step 3: Configure Authentication and Permissions**

* On the configuration parameters page, select your authentication app registration method from:
  * **Rewst Microsoft Cloud Connector**: Recommended for most users for streamlined integration.
  * **Owned App Registration**: For those with an existing setup who prefer to use their own app registrations.
  * **Legacy Rewst App (Deprecated)**: Not recommended; being phased out.

## **Troubleshooting Tips**
