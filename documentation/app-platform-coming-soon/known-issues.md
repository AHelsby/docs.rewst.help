# Known Issues

The purpose of this page is to share known issues in App Platform, as reported by members of the alpha group, that have been recognized and queued for development work during its Alpha stage. While every effort will be made to keep this page as current as possible, given the fast-paced nature of development and the continuous influx of user reports in the Alpha stage, please allow a brief period for changes and additions to be accurately reflected here.

If you stumble across what you believe to be an issue\bug while working with App Platform, please reach out via [Discord](https://discord.gg/rewst) in the `#app-platform` channel. Thank you!!&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
:warning: **PLEASE NOTE** :warning:

App Platform is still under active development, so while some items may masquerade as bugs - there is a possibility that 'it just hasn't been developed yet' at the time it was reported. These items will be considered 'Feature Requests' & will also be tracked and listed towards the bottom of this page.
