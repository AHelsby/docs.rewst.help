# Grid Container

### Introduction

This documentation provides instructions on adding a Grid Container to your canvas and customizing its properties.

### Adding a Grid Container to Your Page

1. **Access the Canvas**: Open the page you're working on in your drag-and-drop website builder.
2. **Drag-and-Drop**: Locate the Grid Container component in your component library, then drag and drop it onto the canvas.

### Configuring the Grid Container

1. **Select the Grid Container**: Click on the added grid container to select it.
2. **Properties Panel**: On the properties panel, you'll find various configurable options:
   * **Styles**: Customize the appearance of the grid container with additional CSS styles.

### Grid Container vs. Container

* **Container Component**: The Container component is a versatile element for structuring content and styling containers. It allows for flexible arrangements but does not enforce a grid structure.
* **Grid Container Component**: The Grid Container component, on the other hand, is specifically designed to create layouts with a grid structure. It simplifies the process of aligning and organizing content in a grid format.

### Why Use the Grid Container Component?

* **Structured Layouts**: Grid containers provide a systematic way to arrange content in rows and columns.
* **Responsive Design**: Easily create responsive designs with grid-based layouts.
* **Consistent Alignment**: Achieve consistent alignment and spacing between items.
