# Data Table

## Introduction

Welcome to the Data Table component documentation! As part of the page builder in App Platform, the Data Table component allows you to display and manage rows of data in a structured, tabular format. This component is essential for MSPs to handle large datasets efficiently, such as client information, service logs, or performance metrics, providing a clear and interactive view of data.

## **Why it exists**

The Data Table component exists to facilitate the organization, interaction, and analysis of complex data within web applications. It provides tools for sorting, filtering, and paging through data, which helps users manage large amounts of information without losing track of their data's context or structure. This is particularly useful in environments where quick data retrieval and clear data presentation are crucial for decision-making and operational efficiency.

## What it could be used for

* Displaying detailed lists of customer tickets and their statuses.
* Managing inventory levels across multiple client sites.
* Showcasing performance reports with sortable metrics.
* Organizing billing and transaction records for easy access and analysis.

## **Example/Use Case**

Consider a scenario where an MSP needs to monitor and manage network equipment across various client sites. The Data Table component can be used to list all equipment, displaying columns for device type, status, last service date, and location. Technicians can quickly sort by any column to prioritize devices that require immediate attention or filter to view only certain types of equipment. This use of the Data Table simplifies the management of numerous devices, ensuring that maintenance is timely and no critical issues are overlooked.
