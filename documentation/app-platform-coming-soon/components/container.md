# Container

## Introduction

Welcome to the Container component documentation! As part of the page builder in App Platform, the Container component allows you to group and organize various UI elements within a structured and styled section. This component is essential for creating visually coherent and logically organized layouts in your web applications.

## **Why it exists**

The Container component exists to provide a flexible and straightforward way to manage layout and design consistency across the application. It helps in encapsulating other components, such as buttons, text, links, and images, ensuring that they align correctly and behave responsively within the designated area. This encapsulation is crucial for maintaining a clean and orderly user interface, which enhances user experience.

## What it could be used for

* Structuring a page into logical sections to improve visual hierarchy.
* Creating a consistent layout that adapts to different screen sizes, enhancing responsiveness.
* Isolating widget-like components that function independently within a page.
* Serving as a design or thematic boundary for different areas within a single page.

## **Example/Use Case**

Imagine setting up a user profile page within an application on the App Platform. The Container component can be strategically utilized to separate information into distinct blocks, such as personal details, contact information, and account settings. Each container ensures that the elements within it, like text fields, images, and buttons, are well-organized and visually distinct from other sections. This not only improves the aesthetics but also enhances the usability of the profile page, making it easier for users to navigate and update their information efficiently.

## Container vs. Grid Container

* **Container Component**: The Container component is a versatile element for structuring content and styling containers. It allows for flexible arrangements but does not enforce a grid structure.
* **Grid Container Component**: The Grid Container component, on the other hand, is specifically designed to create layouts with a grid structure. It simplifies the process of aligning and organizing content in a grid format.

## Adding a Container to your page

1. **Access the Canvas**: Open the page you're working on in edit mode, in App Platform.
2. **Drag-and-Drop**: Locate the 'Container' component in the component library, then drag and drop it onto the canvas.

## Configuring the Container component

1. **Select the Container**: Click on the added container to select it.
2. **Properties Panel**: On the properties panel, you'll find various configurable options:
   * **Background Color**: Set the background color of the container.
   * **Text Color**: Define the text color within the container.
   * **Flex Direction**: Choose the direction of the container's flex items ('row', 'column', etc.).
   * **Alignment (Align Items and Justify Content)**: Align the container's flex items on the cross-axis and main-axis.
   * **Fill Space**: Toggle to make the container fill available space.
   * **Width and Height**: Adjust the width and height of the container.
   * **Padding and Margin**: Set the padding and margin around the container.
   * **Shadow Depth**: Control the shadow depth of the container.
   * **Border-Radius**: Customize the border-radius of the container.
3. **Live Preview**: The canvas provides a live preview of your container as you make changes.
