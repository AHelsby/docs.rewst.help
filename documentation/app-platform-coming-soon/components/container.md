Welcome to the Container Component documentation! As part of the page builder in App Platform, the Container component enables you to structure and style your content on a page within containers effortlessly. Below are instructions on how to add a Container to your canvas and customize its properties.

### Adding a Container to Your Page

1. **Access the Canvas**: Open the page you're working on in your drag-and-drop website builder.
2. **Drag-and-Drop**: Locate the Container component in your component library, then drag and drop it onto the canvas.

### Configuring the Container

1. **Select the Container**: Click on the added container to select it.
2. **Properties Panel**: On the properties panel, you'll find various configurable options:
   * **Background Color**: Set the background color of the container.
   * **Text Color**: Define the text color within the container.
   * **Flex Direction**: Choose the direction of the container's flex items ('row', 'column', etc.).
   * **Alignment (Align Items and Justify Content)**: Align the container's flex items on the cross-axis and main-axis.
   * **Fill Space**: Toggle to make the container fill available space.

### Grid Container vs. Container

* **Container Component**: The Container component is a versatile element for structuring content and styling containers. It allows for flexible arrangements but does not enforce a grid structure.
* **Grid Container Component**: The Grid Container component, on the other hand, is specifically designed to create layouts with a grid structure. It simplifies the process of aligning and organizing content in a grid format.

### Why Use the Container Component?

* **Structure Content**: Containers help organize and structure content on your webpage.
* **Style Flexibility**: Customize the appearance of your containers with various styling options.
