# Link

## Introduction

Welcome to the Link component documentation! As part of the page builder in App Platform, the Link component allows you to embed hyperlinks within your apps, enabling users to navigate to different sections with the app or external sites, or even to download resources with just a click.

## **Why it exists**

Links are fundamental elements of the web, essential for connecting content and guiding user navigation. The Link component exists to streamline the process of integrating these navigational aids into applications, ensuring that users can easily access related resources, both internally and externally, enhancing the overall usability and interactivity of the application.

## What it could be used for...&#x20;

* Navigating to different pages within the application.
* Linking to external websites that provide additional information or resources.
* Downloading files, such as PDFs, directly from the application.
* Initiating email communications by linking to "mailto:" addresses, or other, URL syntax's.

### **Example\Use Case**

Consider an internal company portal where employees need to access various departments. The Link component could be used to create a central dashboard with links to each department. For instance, clicking on a "Human Resources" link might take an employee to an internal HR page where they can find forms and contact information, streamlining navigation and improving the user experience within the portal.

1. **Access the Canvas**: Open the page you're working on in edit mode, in App Platform.
2. **Drag-and-Drop**: Locate the 'Link' component in the component library, then drag and drop it onto the canvas.
