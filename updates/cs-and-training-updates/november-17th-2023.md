<summary><strong>General News and Reminders</strong></summary>

* **Game Tip for the Week:** Did you know The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is included with Game Pass? With the faster load times in this cloud version, it's easier to reload over and over again until you get the Sigil Stone you like, whenever you close those pesky Oblivion gates!
* **SHOUT OUT** to all those who've successfully taken our [foundations-certification.md](../../cluck-university/rewst-foundations-10x/foundations-certification.md "mention")Exam, and collected your prestigious **Certified Rewster** badge in Discord. (Hint to others: It's more than just pretty flare. There's exclusive access it grants, too!)
* Express your **App Platform** Alpha interest by filling out the form.
* **Reminder about Cluck U Holiday Hours:**
  * Live Training will be unavailable from December 18th \~ January 8th for the Holidays and New Year
  * Feel free to sit by the fire, with a glass of bourbon, or a tasty eggnog and watch our videos while you wait with anticipation for our return
* Join us in our [Cluck-U Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/936789089703845988/1121465945295167588) if you have any questions, comments, or concerns!
